# SchoolDistrictDatabase
Test Engineer portion of a group project application that served as a directory for a school district. The user could add
students or teachers, along with relevant information, and then search for them at a later time. 

The files in the repo were used to test this application to ensure all of its intedended user commands worked 
as expected.

The project gave an opportunity to learn about and implement Red Black Trees.
